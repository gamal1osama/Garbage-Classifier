## Overview

This project uses machine learning to automatically classify garbage into different categories. It helps improve waste management and recycling by identifying waste types from images.

**Key Features:**
- 95.2% classification accuracy
- 10 different waste categories
- Real-time image processing
- Easy-to-use web interface
- Two model architectures: CNN and ResNet-101v2

## Classification Categories

The system can identify these waste types:
- Glass
- Paper
- Cardboard
- Plastic
- Organic waste
- E-waste
- Other materials
